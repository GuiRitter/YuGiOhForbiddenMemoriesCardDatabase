# YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesCardDatabase

As I had said in a previous [repository](https://github.com/GuiRitter/YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesNewGameCardList), I wanted to make a better card database and I did. After screenshooting the library information of each card, I made several programs to read the images and extract the card properties from them. Then, I compiled everything in a computer readable table then a human readable list. There's also a human readable table, trimmed to fit [GameFAQ](https://www.gamefaqs.com/)'s 80 (79) characters limit. I tried to post it there, but I had to make some changes which made this project get stuck in the pipeline.

Be aware that all typos from the game (there's a few) have been left as is.

I'll still need to check if my programs are publish-able but, in the meanwhile, I want to leave the results here already.

As I wrongly knew, know that it is _not_ legal to own a [PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console))'s [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS), even if you do own a PlayStation. Fortunately, there's an emulator called [PCSX-Reloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSX-Reloaded) that doesn't need a BIOS, so it's perfectly legal to play emulated PlayStation games, as long as you own the games themselves. If the current build of PCSX-R doesn't work with Yu-Gi-Oh for some reason, use [this](http://pcsxr.codeplex.com/workitem/12066) build.
