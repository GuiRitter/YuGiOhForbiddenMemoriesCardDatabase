# YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesCardDatabase

As I had said in a previous repository, I wanted to make a better card database and I did. After screenshooting the library information of each card, I made several programs to read the images and extract the card properties from them. Then, I compiled everything in a computer readable table then a human readable list. There's also a human readable table, trimmed to fit GameFAQ's 80 (79) characters limit. I tried to post it there, but I had to make some changes which made this project get stuck in the pipeline.

As I wrongly knew, know that it is not legal to own a PlayStation's BIOS, even if you do own a PlayStation. Fortunately, there's an emulator called PCSX-Reloaded (PCSX-R) that doesn't need a BIOS, so it's perfectly legal to play emulated PlayStation games, as long as you own the games themselves.
